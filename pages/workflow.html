											<b>DTM</b> 
											<br> 
											Starting with the DTM obtained through GeoPortale Lombardia, we clipped the layer to our assigned zone. The resolution per pixel of this layer is 5 m/px, and based on this, we decided to also standardise the resolutions of the other layers to match this value. The values in this layer ranges from about 240 meters above the mean sea level (lower Val Cavallina) to a maximum of about 1400 meters, reached in the mountains surrounding the Endine Lake.

											<b>NDVI</b> 
											<br> 
											Computed from ESA Sentinel 2 images, we clipped it from the entire Lombardy region to our case study zone and also resampled from 10 per pixel to 5 meters per pixel to match the choosen common resolution. The scale goes from 0 (lowest vegetation index, usually where there are buildings and roads) to 1 (healty vegetated areas).

Originally the starting layer was in WGS84 projection, so we reprojected it using<code>Warp (Reproject)</code>function into <b>WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N</b> projection and then clipped as the previous layers to our study area. Also in this case we resampled the layer to 5 meters per pixel (original resolution 5.8 m/px).

We obtained it using in the Raster calculator the following formula: <code>"slope@1" &lt; 20 OR "slope@1" &gt; 70</code> and sieving for remove too small areas, not significant for our purposes.<br>The resulting layer is shown below. Also samples from zone in which landslides are already occurred (from IFFI catalogue) are useful, both for removing that zones from computed NLZ as untrue information (since a landslide in that area has already happened) and also as example of area in which a landslide can occur, for the next steps in which we will automatically recognized area at risk.</p>

								<h3>Susceptibility Map</h3>
								

								<p>To generate the susceptibility map we used the classification tool fram the Dzetsaka Plugin. We then converted the classification confidence to class probability using the raster calculator, using this formula <br><code>("classification@1" = 2) * "confidence@1" + ("classification@1" = 1) * (100 - "confidence@1")</code><br>
									Sequentially, to validate the output obtained previously, we used the Accuracy Assessment and Sampling, from the processing scripts tools, on the Susceptibility maps and testing point obtained from the previous computation.

									<h2>Exposure Assessment</h2>

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/QGIS_logo.svg" style="display: block;max-width: 50%;"/></span>
									To conduct the exposure assessment, we acquired and reprojected the population raster dataset to match the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the sub-area vector layer and the susceptibility map obtained in the preceding step.</p>
								<p>Employing the Raster calculator, we categorized the susceptibility raster map into four distinct classes. This is the formula we used:
									<br>
									<code>("susceptibility_map@1" &lt; 25) * 1 + &nbsp; <br> (("susceptibility_map@1" &ge; 25)AND("susceptibility_map@1" &lt; 50)) * 2 + &nbsp; <br> (("susceptibility_map@1" &ge; 50) AND ("susceptibility_map@1" &lt; 75)) * 3 + &nbsp; <br> ("susceptibility_map@1" &ge; 75) * 4</code>
									<br>
									<ul>
										<li>Low: Values in the range [0, 25) %</li>
										<li>Moderate: Values in the range [25, 50) %</li>
										<li>High: Values in the range [50, 75) %</li>
										<li>Very high: Values in the range [75, 100) %</li>
									</ul>
									To determine population exposure, a resampling procedure was conducted on the susceptibility map layer, ensuring its resolution conformed with that of the clipped population raster dataset, which approximated 81.67 meters.
									By utilizing Raster layer zonal statistics, we computed the population count and we subsequencially used the Plugin Plotly to visualize the output through a pie chart illustrating the proportion of population within each susceptibility class before defined.

									<p>The exposure assessment constitutes a crucial aspect in our assessment, indeed it aims at identifying and evaluating elements at risk within landslide susceptible zone. The principal aim of an exposure assessment is to quantify and comprehend the vulnerability of elements like the presence of individuals, of buildings, and infrastructure, facilitating the development of effective strategies for risk mitigation.In this exposure assessment in particular we are going to focus on the percentage of people that may be affected by potential landslide By examinating the spatial correlation between areas prone to landslides and exposed elements, we can indentify high-risk zones and assess the potential repercussions of landslides on human activties.</p>

									From the pie chart is evident that, even though a significant portion of the population resides in areas less prone to landslides, there is a significant percentage population vulnerable to an exceptionally high risk and high risk of landslides. 
									Comparing the data obtained from our analysis with the percentage of population at risk of being affected by landslides in Italy we can see a staggering discrepancy, since the national percentage of population being at risk or at high risk according to ISPRA is 2.2% risk while the percentage of population resulting from out analysis at risk or high risk in the lake Endine surrounding area is

								<li>We had to manually clip the NLZ layer into different sections in order to obtain better distributed points.</li>
								<li>We had to convert integer into the floating-point data type to successfully merge the NLZ and LS-inventory layers.</li>
